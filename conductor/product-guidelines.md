# Product Guidelines - Apex Solver

## Documentation Tone & Style
- **Technical & Precise:** All documentation must prioritize mathematical accuracy and provide deep technical details on implementation.
- **Accessible & Tutorial-Oriented:** Maintain a low barrier to entry by providing clear, step-by-step tutorials and comprehensive examples for common use cases.
- **Performance-Centric:** Consistently communicate performance characteristics, benchmarking results, and the rationale behind optimization choices.

## Visual Identity & Branding
- **Modern & Minimalist:** Professional, clean, and high-trust visual presentation across all documentation and project assets.
- **Developer-Focused:** Prioritize information density for engineers, using code snippets, performance graphs, and technical diagrams as primary communication tools.
- **Visual & Interactive:** Showcase real-time visualization capabilities (e.g., Rerun) to demonstrate the library's power and ease of debugging.

## Contribution & Quality Standards
- **Performance First:** All significant code changes must be accompanied by benchmarks ensuring no regressions and demonstrating efficiency gains where applicable.
- **Mathematical Integrity:** New factors, manifolds, or algorithms require documented mathematical derivations or explicit references to authoritative literature.
- **Robustness & Safety:** Strictly adhere to project-wide safety rules (no `unwrap`/`expect`) and utilize structured tracing for all logging and diagnostics.
